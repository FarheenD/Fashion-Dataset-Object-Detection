## Overview

Fashion Object Detection is a project aimed at detecting and classifying various fashion items in images. The project explores the efficacy of different YOLO versions (YOLOv8, different versions of YOLO NAS etc.) in terms of accuracy and performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Fashion Object Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nguyngiabol/colorful-fashion-dataset-for-object-detection) available on Kaggle. It contains images of fashion items with annotations for object detection tasks.

## YOLO Versions

This project evaluates the following versions of YOLO:

- YOLOv8
- YOLO-NAS S
- YOLO-NAS M
- YOLO-NAS L
Each version of YOLO is trained and tested on the Fashion Object Detection dataset to compare their performance.
